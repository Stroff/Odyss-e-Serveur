-- [Culling of Stratholme] Instance by John Holiver
-- Much work done, the instance is playable with this
-- Although there're things that aren't implemented yet
-- * Random placement of risen zombies after MalGanis transform some
-- * Recovery of the city in case of Reset()
-- * Heroic timer for Infinite Corruptor spawn
-- Known bugs (that if i knew where to fix i would do it):
-- * Jaina get spawned 2 times on the beggining
